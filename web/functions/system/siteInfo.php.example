/* KFM set up:
KFM is the filemanager used by the system. It uses mysql as a database, so we need to provide it with information on connection and where to store files (incl. images). Further settings can be set directly in the CMS/kfm/configuration.php file.

You can use the same database as your frometou uses, you just need to make sure that the variable $kfm_db_prefix is set to something in the kfm/configuration.php file:
$SITE_INFO_KFM_HOST=$SITE_INFO_DB_HOST;
$SITE_INFO_KFM_NAME=$SITE_INFO_DB_NAME;
$SITE_INFO_KFM_USER=$SITE_INFO_DB_USER;
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PASS=$SITE_INFO_DB_PASS;
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PREFIX="kfm_";

Or use a separate database:
$SITE_INFO_KFM_HOST='localhost';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_NAME='frometou_kfm';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_USER='frometou_kfm_u';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PASS='frometou_kfm_p';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PREFIX="kfm_";

$SITE_INFO_KFM_USER='frometou_kfm_u';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PASS='frometou_kfm_p';
$SITE_INFO_KFM_PREFIX="kfm_";
